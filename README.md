## About
Age of discovery(AOD) is an MMORPG game built with zkSNARKs on Ethereum and BSC, dealing with sailing and trading, themed around the Age of Discovery inspring by Uncharted Water. In the games, the player takes up the role of a captain (or commodore in some translations) and manages a seagoing fleet to participate in trades, privateering, treasure hunting, exploration, and plain piracy. The player can also explore into AI generated random world to discover infinity metaverse.

The original game was developed by timewarpsgh after two years of development in python and opensourced in Github use original Uncharted water sprite tiles. Our goals is to remake it to support more features and gameplay for multi players.

A 2D MMORPG with a nautical theme.

It allows players to go back to the Middle Ages and take on the role of heroes in an adventure.
The game includes an adventure story line carefully designed by the creator over a long period of time, while players are free to collect experience, gain savings, engage in economic and trade activities, and upgrade their ships. Participate in maritime battles, obtain loot, and expand the world map. At the same time, the game introduces a weather system, the management of supplies during the voyage, and a more difficult and realistic combat experience in order to add a more realistic sailing experience.

Currently the game is on Algo network, users can log in and participate in the game through Algo Wallet, in the future the game will be more deeply bound for Algo network, including but not only assets. We will listen to more ideas on the game mechanics.

## Features

### Decentralized Digital Worlds
We want to build a massively-multiplayer persistent and economic universe, interoperable with the rest of the Ethereum metaverse. We believe that zkSNARKs will unlock the first generation of truly compelling decentralized games, and that decentralized games will pave the way for the community-owned and community-designed digital worlds of the future. 


### Community-driven
Beyond working on the game itself, our team also works closely with Project Sophon, a group of players working on third-party tools. Our vision is for the gameplay experience to be built and freely modified by the community. For a taste of this, see the Community mods Homepage. 

## Gameplay

### Explore
There is a romance in participating in a voyage to explore the unknown, and in AoD, players can sail ships, cross straits, and brave extreme weather to unexplored lands. As well as landing on uninhabited islands and reaching out to new lands. Participating in exploration not only has the sense of accomplishment of achieving your goals, but also offers great rewards such as artifact.
### Trade
In AoD, trade is the usual means by which players acquire resources, whether it's building large ships or hiring more sailors, it must be done by constantly trading for gold. Trade, in addition to the risks from the outside world, varies from city to city in terms of its ability to digest, resulting in massive dumping that can gradually reduce earnings or even losses. The information between players can be used to maximize profits by preparing goods for cities with shortages and hot sales.
### Build
Players can use gold to build normal ships. However, larger or special ships require local reputation and even special materials to build. Advanced ships can be traded by players as an NFT.
Players can freely configure the ship's cabin composition. Some ships also have unique compartments such as fresh water compartment, dining room, etc. to make the ship more capable. In AoD, you can collect bow statues, sails, and various guns to arm your ship to achieve the desired performance.
### Battle
Battles will take place in a square space where the terrain random parameters depend on the coordinates of the trigger location, and both sides will fight from both ends of the map in a classic SLG fashion. Even if there is a performance gap between ships, players can still overcome the weak with the strong if they use their tactical talents.
### Diplomacy
When players are organized together, when players have access to high ranking officials in the port. Then organization and diplomacy will be essential. Players can set up fleets of ships and merchants among themselves to increase the efficiency of trade. And cooperation can be established between players and ports to get greater supply of goods and build more powerful ships. And players will also have different diplomatic status with each other because of different opinions.
### Subworld
Exploration of Subworld will be an essential experience for players in the later stages. Randomly generated by the AI, there are strong enemies and artifact in the Subworld. No matter how many times you have entered, you will have a new experience. What's more, players can also contribute ideas to make the Subworld have more rich content. More people involved in the idea, always better than a few people in the idea.
## How to Participate

### For Developers

AOD is in Typescript, and gameplay scripting is in JSON. Game logic, artwork, and data can easily be changed through data files. The engine itself is modular in design to provide maximal flexibility while still remaining efficient. Anyone can download, build and run the latest version of the game.

If you’re a programmer and you want to contribute to AOD, just get your feet wet and get started. We don’t want to hinder your progress with any applications. If you do a good job over time, you’ll get inducted to the team anyway.

We use github for revision control, and Trac for documentation and issue-tracking. Our technical discussions are conducted on the forums and over IRC. You could create a patch and submit it to us, and we’ll then review it and maybe suggest some changes or commit it to github. Contributors who make consistent contributions to the codebase are offered permissions to commit directly to our github codebase.

### For Artists

Like the codebase, AOD art is also “open source”. The models and animations can be created in the software of your choice, as long as it capable of exporting COLLADA files (.DAE). Similarly, the 2D textures are exported though the paint software of your choice to a Direct Draw Surface (.DDS) file. The alpha channel of the texture is used to define player color, object color, or transparency.

The art assets are organized in XML files called ‘actors’, which define entities in the game. An actor declares callouts for models, textures, and animations, if applicable. Since you can specify alternate textures and props to an entity, you can use the AOD. art model to allow for randomness in the art. That way, several instances of the same Celtic warrior could appear in battle with variant hair colors, and two adjacent instances of the same Greek house could have pots and carpets aligned differently, so they’ll seldom look exactly alike.

Templates to help you make art assets (like textures and meshes) are readily available. Also, various tutorials and guides will allow you to hit the ground running. More information about the nuts and bolts of creating art assets for AOD can be found here. Check out our open art development forum, and feel free to participate!
